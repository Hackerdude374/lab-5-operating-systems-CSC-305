In this lab you will write a program in c++ that will communicate between system processes to accomplish a task.
NOTE: This lab will only work on linux as the unistd.h library is for linux system commands.
The c library unistd.h needs to be included in order for the functions, "pipe", "fork", "read", "write", "close"
Pipe documentation, http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/pipe.2.html
another example, using pipes and forks
